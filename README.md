# sortable-post-list-app

This is a Vue 3 application that utilizes Pinia for state management, Axios for Http request, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
This project marks my first experience with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that offers a new and efficient way to style web components.
Recommended node version: 20.10.0
